EVALUATION:
* Basic Image Classification (Downstream Model Tuning Single Image Representation)
* 3D Evaluation (Downstream ADNI Classification Showing Value of 3D Handling)
  - Our Model
  - 2D (Temporal) Version of Our Model
  - 2D (Non-Temporal) Version of Our Model
  - Pretrained Models on Middle Slices
* Temporal Evaluation (ADNI Dataset New Label and Others w/ At Least 3 Images Next Label)
  - Our Model
  - Non-Temporal Version of Our Model
  - Pretrained Models on Most Recent Image
* Embedding Retrieval Task
* Qualitative Embedding Visualization
  - 3D Patterns
  - Temporal Patterns
* Figure Out Resolution
  - Do We Need Multi-Resolution (Nice Part of Flexibility Story, Also Adds Challenge to Model)
  - How Do We Evaluate Beyond a Method Without (Which Likely Improves Performance)?


MODELS:
* 2D Version of Our Model
* 2D Non-Temporal Version of Our Model
* 3D Non-Temporal Version of Our Model
* Basic (2D, Non-Temporal, Fixed Image Size)


TO DO:
* Retrieval Task (Labeled vs. Unlabeled)
* Add Additional ADNI Temporal Labels
